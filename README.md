# MATH40002 &ndash; Analysis I

Some Analysis I related stuff in Lean, currently there are real-valued sequences and their limits.

1. Chapter 3 &ndash; Sequences
- `src/seq_def.lean` contains definitions related to real sequences, including
    + Bounded sequence
    + Limits and convergence of sequences
    + Monotone sequence
    + Cauchy sequence
    + Subsequences
- `src/seq.lean` contains examples and propositions as in the lecture notes. Currently propositions include
    + Uniqueness of limits
    + Algebra of limits
    + Monotone convergence theorem
    + Order limit theorem
    + Convergent if and only if Cauchy
